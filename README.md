# Cat-and-Mouse Robot Project

## Introduction
This project aims to design and build a **mobile robotic system** capable of playing a ‚Äúcat and mouse‚Äù pursuit game.  
It combines **real-time embedded control**, **sensor fusion**, and **mechanical design** to create an autonomous robot capable of chasing or evading another robot in a dynamic environment.
In addition tothat we built ESP32-S3 based audio system capable of **listening by a mic** and answering using **AI based model using wifi connection and online server.**

## Hardware :

The hardware design is divided into two main parts:

### 1.Electronics
The electronic subsystem provides sensing, control, and communication between the robot‚Äôs components.
#### Motherboard

##### V1

<img width="505" height="468" alt="MB_v1_back" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c87e954-cd57-4a87-8d75-f7a1b9186ea7" />

**Main features:**
- **Microcontroller:** 480Mhz STM32H743 in TFBGA100 package, 1MB RAM 2MB Flash 
- **Sensors:** ADXL343 accelerometer and 3x TOF sensor 
- **Actuators:** UART COM for each STM32 FOC controller
- **Power Management:** 2.5A 5V buck, separate 3.3V ldo between mcu and accelerometer.  
- **Communication:** SPI / UART / Wireless link via esp32-C6
- **Features:** Up to 1Gb nand flash of 512Mb Nor flash 
##### V2

<img width="407" height="431" alt="mb_v2_back" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b39e27e-b79e-4786-a5c8-040d7c2a8e96" />
This version improve the audio part by adding a micro sd card wich replace the previous NOR flash in order to get fasdter read and write speed, on top of that we moved all the **audio processing into a faster esp32-S3** wich is communication with the stm32 by a uart link, it permit us to get **real IA functionnality** by using wifi link and also communicate with the **STM32 who control all the movement part of the Robot**.
Finally this board is designed as a two board stack with the FOC controller v2.

**Main features:**
- **Microcontroller:** 480Mhz STM32H743 in TFBGA100 package, 1MB RAM 2MB Flash 
- **Sensors:** ADXL343 accelerometer and 3x TOF sensor, ICS43434 I2S mems microphone 
- **Actuators:** UART COM for each STM32 FOC controller
- **Power Management:** 2.5A 5V buck, separate 3.3V ldo between mcu and accelerometer.  
- **Communication:** SPI / UART / Wireless link via esp32-s3
- **Features:** Sd card port and esp32-s3 to manage all the audio part with class d amplifier max99357 and microphone in order to get ia answer vio wifi call to an api.

In developpment...


### 2.Mechanics
The mechanical subsystem handles motion, traction, and physical interaction.

**Main features:**
- **Chassis:** Lightweight 3D-printed or CNC-machined frame  
- **Drive System:** Differential or mecanum wheels for agile motion  
- **Mounts:** Sensor and board supports designed for modular assembly  
- **Simulation / CAD:** Designed in Fusion 360 / SolidWorks

## Software (Overview)
While hardware is the main focus, the robot also runs control and perception algorithms:

- **Real-time tasks:** Sensor acquisition, motor control, communication  
- **Sensor fusion:** Madgwick filter for attitude estimation  
- **Behavior layer:** Cat-and-mouse logic (chase / evade modes)  
- **Debug tools:** UART logs, LED indicators, optional telemetry GUI
